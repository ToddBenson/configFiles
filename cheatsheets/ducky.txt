# Rubber Ducky

Ducky Script syntax is simple. Each command resides on a new line and may have options follow. Commands are written
in ALL CAPS. Most commands invoke keystrokes, key-combos or strings of text, while some offer delays or pauses.

REM - Similar to the REM command in Basic and other languages, lines beginning with REM will not be processed. 
DEFAULTDELAY n - defines how long (in milliseconds * 10) to wait between each subsequent command.
DELAY n - creates a momentary pause in the ducky script (in milliseconds * 10) from 1 to 10000.
STRING - processes the text following taking special care to auto-shift. STRING can accept a single or multiple characters.
      a..z A..Z 0..9 !..) `~ += _- ”' :; <, >. ?/ \ |
GUI - Emulates the Windows-Key, sometimes referred to as the Super-key.
MENU - Emulates the App key, sometimes referred to as the menu key or context menu key.
SHIFT - can be used when navigating fields to select text, among other functions. Accept the following:
     DELETE, HOME, INSERT, PAGEUP, PAGEDOWN, WINDOWS, GUI, UPARROW, DOWNARROW, LEFTARROW, RIGHTARROW, TAB
ALT - accepts END, ESC, ESCAPE, F1…F12, Single Char, SPACE, TAB
CTRL - accepts BREAK, PAUSE, F1…F12, ESCAPE, ESC, Single Char 
Arrow Keys - DOWNARROW, UPARROW, LEFTARROW, RIGHTARROW
More Keys - BREAK, PAUSE, CAPSLOCK, DELETE, END, ESC, ESCAPE, HOME, INSERT, NUMLOCK,
PAGEUP, PAGEDOWN, PRINTSCREEN, SCROLLLOCK, SPACE, TAB

# Getting Started

1. Write a payload in your text editor of choice
Any standard ASCII text editor can be used, such as notepad, vi, nano, emacs or textedit. For example, open notepad and
write “STRING Hello World” (without quotes). Save the file as mypayload.txt. Reference the Ducky Script on the next page
for syntax details or visit USBRubberDucky.com for example payloads.

2. Encode your payload with the Duck Encoder utility
Download the latest version of duckencoder from USBRubberDucky.com. This cross-platform command line Java app
encodes the ASCII text file into a binary ready to be processed by the USB Rubber Ducky.
java -jar duckencode.jar -i mypayload.txt -o inject.bin Usage:

3. Copy the encoded payload to the Micro SD card
Place the inject.bin file created by the Duck Encoder on the root of the Micro SD card. Your payload is now ready.

4. Insert the Micro SD card into the USB Rubber Ducky
Slide the Micro SD card completely into the reader on the USB Rubber Ducky. The card will rest flush with the board.

5. Plug the USB Rubber Ducky into your target PC
The USB Rubber Ducky will be recognized as a keyboard and automatically begin executing your payload. In the example
above the text "Hello World" is typed. Press the micro button above the Micro SD card slot to repeat the payload.
